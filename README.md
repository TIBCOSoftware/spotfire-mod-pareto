# Pareto Chart Mod for TIBCO Spotfire®

<img src="assets/pareto.png" width="60%"/>

Highlight the most important among a (typically large) set of factors by combining both bars and line charts, with individual values represented by bars in descending order, and the cumulative total represented by the line.

Pareto charts are useful when analyzing data where many courses of action are competing for attention, for instance indicating the frequency or causes of problems, as well as their cumulative impact. Pareto charts help to find the problems to prioritize in order to observe the greatest overall improvement.
